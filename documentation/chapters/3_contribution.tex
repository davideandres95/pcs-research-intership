\section{Notation}
In the following we will use the notation:
\begin{align*}
	\mathbb{I} \left(X , Y; D, P_M, C_M \right)
\end{align*}
which expresses the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ and $D, P_M, C_M$, separated by a semi-colon, are the trainable parameters of the system. $D$ stands for the posterior probability distribution learnt by the demapper, $P_M$ stands for the source's probability distribution learnt by the encoder, and $C_M$ stands for the spatial distribution of the constellation points learnt by the mapper. These parameters can be seen as additional input to a function.

\section{First implementation}
In this section we break-down the autoencoder system presented by \citet{Stark}.
\subsection{Optimization of trainable parameters}
As we have seen in Chapter \ref{chap:preliminaries}, the goal of probabilistic constellation shaping is to maximize the \cgls{mi}. To this end, defining an appropriate loss function is critical. Starting from the demodulator, the categorial cross entropy loss
\begin{align}
	L(D, P_M, C_M) \triangleq \mathbb{X}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y}; D) = \mathbb{E}\left[-\log_2(Q(X|Y;D))\right] 
\end{align}

is appropriate for training $D$, but not for $P_M$ and $C_M$. A modification of this loss function is necessary to ensure that the end-to-end \cgls{mi} is maximized. The following expansions will come handy
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{H}(X) = \mathbb{X}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y}) - \mathbb{D}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y})
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{H}(X|Y=y) = \mathbb{X}(P_{X|y}||Q_{X|y}|Y=y) - \mathbb{D}(P_{X|y}||Q_{X|y}|Y=y)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{H}(X|Y) = \mathbb{E}_y\left[\mathbb{X}(P_{X|y}||Q_{X|y}|Y=y)\right] - \mathbb{E}_y \left[\mathbb{D}(P_{X|y}||Q_{X|y}|Y=y)\right].
\end{align}
Using the last expansion we can rewrite the mutual information in terms of the categorical cross entropy
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{I} \left(X , Y\right) = \mathbb{H}(X) - \mathbb{X}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y}) + \mathbb{D}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y}).
\end{align}
And the categorical cross entropy loss function becomes 
\begin{align}
	L(D, P_M, C_M) \triangleq \mathbb{H}(X) - \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y\right) + \mathbb{D}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y}).
\end{align}
So, if $L$ is minimized during training, the source entropy is unwantedly minimized. To avoid this effect, \citeauthor{Stark} modify the loss function as
\begin{align}
	\hat{L}(D, P_M, C_M) \triangleq L(D, P_M, C_M) - \mathbb{H}(X).
\end{align}
With this correction the optimization problem 
\begin{align}
	\min_{D, P_M, C_M}\hat{L}(D, P_M, C_M) = \max_{D, P_M, C_M} \{ \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y\right) - \mathbb{D}(P_{X|Y}||Q_{X|Y})\}
\end{align}
maximizes the \cgls{mi}.
\subsection{Autoencoder Architecture}

	\centering	
	\caption{Proposed Autoencoder Architecture from \cite{Stark}}
	\label{fig:starkAe}
\end{figure}

\citeauthor{Stark}'s autoencoder is made up from three major blocks: sampler, modulator, and demodulator. Fig \ref{fig:starkAe} shows the complete architecture of the end-to-end system, where the trainable parameters $p_{\theta_S}(s), f_{\theta_M} \text{ and } p_{\theta_D}(s|y)$ correspond to our $P_M, C_M, \text{ and } D$, respectively. While the modulator and demodulator blocks are similar to the proposal from \cite{O'Shea}, the simultaneous probabilistic shaping is possible thanks to the careful design of the sampler. By ensuring that the sampler mechanism is differentiable, the gradients with respect to each $p_i \in P_M$ are precise when calculated via \cgls{sgd}. In fact, the differentiability is gained by leveraging the so-called \textit{Gumbel-Softmax trick} \cite{JANG}, which circunvents the need for using the arg-max function to sample the discrete distribution $P_M$.

We have implemented the end-to-end system using PyTorch \cite{PyTorch}. The sampler is made out of 2 layers. The first layer is made out of 128 units with ReLU activation, and the second layer of M units with linear activations. In the forward pass, the logit output is then processed through the Gumbel-Softmax trick and then through the straight-through estimator to produce the one-hot-encoded training set. While in the backward pass, the straight-through estimator uses the approximate one-hot vector ---the output of the Gumbel-Softmax block. The trainable parameter of the sampler, $P_M$, is initialized to a uniform distribution.
The modulator is made out of a single linear layer of N units followed by a normalization operation to ensure that the energy constraint of the constellation is mantained, i.e.,
\begin{align}
	\sum\limits_{p_i \in P_M} p_i |x_i|^2.
\end{align}
If only probabilistic shaping is applied, the constellation remains fixed, e.g., M-\cgls{ask}, is used. On the contrary, when geometric shaping is performed, the parameter $C_M$ corresponds to the unnormalized constellation points.
Finally, the demodulator is made out of 3 layers. The first two layers are made out of 128 units with ReLU activations, and the third layer of M units with linear activation. The trainable parameter of the demodulator, $D$ corresponds to the \textit{a posteriori} probabilities $p(x|y)$.

\subsection{Autoencoder Performance}

Training was performed with the Adam optimizer and the hyper-parameters of the training were: learning-rate 0.001, batch-size 10000, and number of epochs 4000.
The resulting M-\cgls{ask} constellations for both only probabilistic and joint probabilistic and geometric shaping are presented in Figure \ref{fig:starkMASK}. Moreover the respective achieved \cgls{mi} for the corresponding M-\cgls{qam} scheme, i.e., 64-\cgls{qam}, are available for SNR values ranging from 5dB to 22dB in Figure \ref{fig:starkPerf}.

\section{Second implementation}
In this section we break-down the autoencoder system presented by \citet{Aref}. This novel approach calls to remove the risk of numerical instabilities present in \cite{Stark}. Such instabilities are introduced by the Gumbel-Softmax trick, required to make the sampler differentiable, and the sensitive extra hyper-parameters. The outstanding feature of this autoencoder is the hability to sample from the constellation probabilities without any approximation.

\subsection{Optimization of trainable parameters}
\label{sec:parameters}
As we have seen in Chapter \ref{chap:preliminaries}, the goal of probabilistic constellation shaping is to maximize the mutual information
\begin{align}
	 \max_{D, P_M, C_M} \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y ; D, P_M, C_M \right) = \mathbb{H}(X) - \mathbb{X}(P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y} ; D, P_M, C_M)
\end{align}

where the entropy is maximized when the symbols' probabilities follow a \cgls{mb} distribution; and the cross-equivocation is minimum when $Q_{X|Y} = P_{X|Y}$.

Typically, the gradient descent (or ascent, as we intent to maximize) allows us to solve the optimization problem by adjusting the trainable parameters as:
\begin{align}
	\theta_{new} = \theta_{old} + \epsilon \pdv{\theta_{old}} \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y ; \theta_{old} \right)
\end{align}
for all trainable parameters $\theta \in P_M, C_M, D$. And the \cgls{mi} can be numerically approximated by
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{I} \left(X , Y\right) \approx \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y\right)_{\text{num}} &= \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{B} - \log_2(P(x_i)) + \log_2(Q_{X|Y}(x_i|y_i))\\
	&= \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{B} L(x_i, y_i).
\end{align}

Next, the following approximation usually allows to adjust the trainable parameters:
\begin{align}
	\pdv{\theta} \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y ; \theta \right) \approx \pdv{\theta} \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y\right)_{\text{num}} = \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{B} L(x_i, y_i).
\end{align}

However, Aref claims that although this is true for the constellation locations $(\theta \in C_M)$ and the demapper parameters $(\theta \in D)$, it does not hold for the constellation probabilities $\{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_M\} = P_M$
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:mi_pdv_p}
	\pdv{p_j} \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y ; P_M \right) \not\approx \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{B} \pdv{p_j} L(x_i, y_i)
\end{align}

as $\{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_M\}$ changes the statistics of the training set.

For this reason, (\ref{eqn:mi_pdv_p}) must be computed differently. On the one hand, to compute the derivative of the cross-equivocation, the following expansions are useful
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{X}\left(P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y} \vert Y=b \right) = \sum \limits_{a \in Supp(P_{X|Y}(\cdot|b))} P_{X|Y}(a|b) \log_2(Q_{X|Y}(a|b))
\end{align}

\begin{align}
	\mathbb{X}\left(P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y}\right) = \sum \limits_{b \in Supp(P_Y)} P_Y(b) \mathbb{X}\left( P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y} \vert Y=b \right) 
\end{align}

as combined together and applying Bayes' theorem they yield

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:CE_expanded}
	\mathbb{X}\left(P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y}\right) = \sum \limits_{(a,b) \in Supp(P_{XY})} P_X(a) P_{Y|X}(b|a) \log_2(Q_{X|Y}(a|b)). 
\end{align}

And so, the derivative results
\begin{align}
	\pdv{p_j} \mathbb{X}\left(P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y}\right) &= \sum \limits_{b \text{ if } x=j} P_{Y|X}(b|j) \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(j|b) \\
	& + \sum \limits_{(a,b) \in Supp(P_{XY})} P_{XY}(a, b) \pdv{p_j} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(a|b)
\end{align}
which can be rewritten using the expectation operator as
\begin{align}
	\pdv{p_j} \mathbb{X}\left(P_{X|Y} \Vert Q_{X|Y}\right) &= \mathbb{E}_{Y|X}[ \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(j|b)| X=j] \\
	& + \mathbb{E}_{XY}[ \pdv{p_j} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(a|b)].
\end{align}
The terms can now be numerically computed as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:CE_term_1}
	\mathbb{E}_{Y|X}[ \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(j|b)| X=j] \approx \dfrac{1}{Bp_j}\sum \limits_{b \text{ if } x=j} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(j|b)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:CE_term_2}
	\mathbb{E}_{XY}[ \pdv{p_j} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(a|b)] \approx \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{(a,b) \in Supp(P_{XY})} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(a|b).
\end{align}
On the other hand, the derivative of the entropy w.r.t. $p_j$ is
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:H_term_1}
	\pdv{p_j} \mathbb{H}(X) = \pdv{p_j} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{B} - p_i \log_2(p_i) = - \log_2 (p_j) - log_2 (e).
\end{align}

Now, combining (\ref{eqn:CE_term_1}), (\ref{eqn:CE_term_2}), and (\ref{eqn:H_term_1}) the derivative of the mutual information w.r.t. $p_j$, (\ref{eqn:mi_pdv_p}), can be computed as
\begin{align}
	\pdv{p_j} \mathbb{I} \left(X , Y ; P_M \right) \approx - \log_2 (p_j) - \log_2 (e) + \dfrac{1}{Bp_j}\sum \limits_{b \text{ if } x=j} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(j|b) + \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{(a,b)} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(a|b)
\end{align}

Aref now indicates that the following terms can be computed via backpropagation
\begin{align}
	- \log_2 (p_j) + \dfrac{1}{Bp_j}\sum \limits_{b \text{ if } x=j} \log_2 Q_{X|Y}(j|b) = \dfrac{1}{B} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{B} \pdv{p_j} L(x_i, y_i)
\end{align}
while the remaining ones must be explicitely computed and added to the gradient after backpropagating. We call this step \textit{gradient correction} and it is due to the change of statistics in the sampled batch.

\subsection{Autoencoder Architecture}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/aref_diagram.png}
	\caption{Proposed Autoencoder Architecture from \cite{Aref}}
	\label{fig:arefAe}
\end{figure}

\citeauthor{Aref}'s autoencoder is made up from two major blocks: mapper and demapper. Fig \ref{fig:arefAe} shows the complete architecture of the end-to-end system, where the trainable parameters are $P_M, C_M, \text{ and } D$. Furthermore, the mapper breaks down into the sampling and the modulation mechanism. In order to sample, a single linear layer followed by a softmax layer trains the $p_i \in P_M$. Next, to produce a training symbols batch of size B, each index $i$ is drawn about $Bp_i$ times, for $i = 1, \dots, M$. After, the indeces are randomly permuted. Note that this sampling mechanism is not differentiable and consequently, the derivatives of the loss function w.r.t to the $p_i$ will not be accurate. However, using the \textit{gradient correction} factor described in Section \ref{sec:parameters}, the gradient is adjusted during the backpropagation step. Similar to the previously presented architecture, the modulation mechanism is made of a single linear layer of M units and trainable parameters $c_i \in C_M$. It also includes a normalization layer to ensure that the power contstraints are met. Finally, the Demapper is also made of a single linear layer followed by a softmax layer. The demapper's trainable parameter, $D$ correspond to the \textit{a posteriori} probability distribution $p(x|y)$ depending on the channel model.

\subsection{Autoencoder Performance}
Training was performed with the Adam optimizer and the hyper-parameters of the training are: learning-rate=0.1, batch-size=10000, and number of epochs=4000.
The resulting M-\cgls{ask} constellations for both only probabilistic and joint probabilistic and geometric shaping are presented in Figure \ref{fig:arefMASK}. Moreover the respective achieved \cgls{mi} for the corresponding M-\cgls{qam} scheme, i.e., 64-\cgls{qam}, are available in Figure \ref{fig:arefPerf} for SNR values ranging from 5dB to 22dB.
